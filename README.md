This project performs a complete bioinformatics pipeline to analyze genetic similarities between SARS-CoV-2 variants from different countries. Starting from GenBank accession numbers, the workflow downloads sequences, aligns them, computes nucleotide composition, and constructs a phylogenetic tree using distance-based methods.
